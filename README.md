# AirBnB Console application

## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration… 

## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

To start the command line intepreter in interactive mode, you go to the root folder of the application and run `./console.py`
You can also run in non-interactive mode eg: `echo "help" | ./console.py`
